###Intro
We're exploring more ways to help the team get a stronger foundation of F#.  

###Goals
There are some goals I would like to achieve, all of which are part of the greater vision of empowering others, which is a core value of RealtyShares:  
1. Language or library fluency: A session could serve to provide a better understanding of how to use a group of specific functions or operators. 
2. Team knowledge of each other's strengths and weaknesses with functional programming. This helps with targeting further training and assignment of tasks.  
3. Morale - This should be something that helps everyone remember that this is a great place to work, and feel valued on the team.

###Session schedule and accessibility  
Once every week, either Thursday or Friday, team members will meet in one of the conference rooms, or optionally online. The session must be fully user-friendly via Internet as we have remote people on the team. The session will exist on Google Calendar as a recurring weekly meeting. If this system proves popular and productive, we can even consider doing these more often than once per week.

###Hosts
Each instance of the session will have a host. The host will be the one who chooses a programming problem for the team to solve, and also presides over the session as a whole. I don't want to have a rotating schedule of hosts, as that puts pressure to come up with problems to solve, and when it comes time for one person to host, they may not have had the inspiration to come up with an interesting challenge that would be good for the team, and therefore the quality would suffer. So the hosting should be on a voluntary basis.

###Proposing a session
If the Google Calendar session does not have a host yet, the name of that week's session will, instead of the topic name, contain "TBD". If someone wants to host and present their own session, they will pick one of the session that is marked as TBD, and then submit their proposed problem topic to Dan, with a rationale of why that topic is good for the team to practice on as a group. When Dan updates the calendar event with the name of the topic, that will be a confirmation of the session's agenda.   

###Problem presentation 
One programming problem will be presented to the team to solve. The rationale and takeaway goals should be explained as part of this. The problem could have more than one part, as long as the entire set is something that could reasonably be done in 15 minutes. 

###Work phase 
There will be 15 minutes to come up with a way to solve it. You will be allowed to use your laptop, but should be prepared to present on a whiteboard. If you are unable to solve the problem, that is okay, there shouldn't be any pressure to solve it. The goal is to teach and not to test. Everybody must submit their code and notes (whatever they have) to the host by the time the 15 minutes are up. It is probably a good thing if not everyone can easily solve the problem as it means that we've proven that we are improving our knowledge in this session. Attempting the problem before actually teaching the team how to solve it, helps prime the brain for more efficiently learning that topic. It is much easier to learn to do something after you've tried and failed to do it yourself. Additionally, there may be suboptimal ways to solve the problem, so it is also good for everybody to solve the problem in the way that they know how to do it, so that any suboptimal knowledge is improved upon.

###Solution presentation
The host will select one volunteer to present their solution (for up to 5 minutes). If nobody volunteers, the host will present his or her own solution to the meeting. The main purpose of this presentation will be to explain not so much the solution itself, but the concepts utilized in the solution.

###Q&A   
For up to 5 minutes after the presentation, there will be opportunities for questions to be asked. Anyone can ask a question and anyone is free to answer them.  

###Meeting archive
The host will archive all notes from the meeting into a Company Google Drive folder (within the Engineering folder). The file will be in Google Docs format. The naming format of the file will be "YYYY-MM-DD - Problem Topic}".

###Task assignments
Optionally, the sessions could coexist with items that are part of the current sprint. To get a deeper understanding of the topics, somebody on the team who has expressed interest in getting further practice, could be assigned to a story or issue which uses those topics.

###Example problems
Here are some examples of challenges that others have come up with. I'm not sure if it would serve us best to use any of these. Our time to meet together is limited and we should choose our topics carefully, to get the most bang for our buck. Additionally, the existing challenges I've found aren't necessarily designed for the sake of teaching specific concepts, but rather for solo practice. I've listed the challenges below for the sake of example.
