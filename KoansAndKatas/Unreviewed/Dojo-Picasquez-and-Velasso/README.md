Dojo: Picasquez and Velasso
==========================

This dojo is all about manipulating images and creating mashups, [like this][Warhol-vs-Da-Vinci]:

If you want to try it out by yourself, clone or download this project, and follow the instructions in /dojo/script.fsx 

If you want to organize the dojo in your local community, the folder /organizer contains some instructions.  

Let us know what you like and don't like, and how to make it better, and... have fun, and happy coding!
